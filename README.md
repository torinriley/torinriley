I'm Torin Etheridge (he/him), a student and startup founder. In addition to my work at my startup, Eco Grow AI, I've also worked on the Reflective Diologue system, one of the first reflective AI farmworks that can be used with any LLM API. I've also made several open source machine learning tools and libraries, that I've personally found useful in my work. I have experience not only in Machine learning but also in full-stack web development and IOS app development.
